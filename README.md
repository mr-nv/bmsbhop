Simple Black Mesa autobhop

# How to use
Find an injector like Xenos or Extreme Injector. Don't use these ones without -insecure in your Black Mesa launch options, as they are VAC detected

# In future
If it crashes then it's probably outdated. You will need to find new offsets/patterns/interface names/whatever. Use google
